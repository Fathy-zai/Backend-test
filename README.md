# Backend-test
a little project used to teach me about coding practices

TOM: As I mentioned in our chat, it would have been good to see some more stuff in the readme, e.g. how to run the app and tests, what decisions were made and why, thoughts on extension.

TOM: The project structure looks pretty good to me. A typical Go project layout.
